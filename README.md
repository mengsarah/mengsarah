### Hello! ###

I'm a recent computer science graduate. I'm working on projects while searching for a job.

As of August 2020, I have been working on:
* [SyllabiShare](https://github.com/SyllabiShare/syllabi-share), a syllabus respository site for college students
* [Job App Tracker](https://github.com/mengsarah/jobapps), a personal tracker for the various steps in job applications

[My website](https://mengsarah.github.io/)
